## Explanation
In Azure pipelines, jobs can run in parallel to increase the overall efficiency of a pipeline. This is achieved through the estimation of parallel jobs and configuring pipelines to run multiple jobs simultaneously. Both the visual designer and YAML language support parallel jobs. Therefore, pipelines can be created using either method to take advantage of concurrent execution.
