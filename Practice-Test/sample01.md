# How to Author Practice Test(Knowledge Assessment) in GitHub?

1. Create a **Public GitHub Repository**.

2. Provide an access to the required members of the team.

3. Follow the below steps to create Questions for the Assessment.

**Note:**
   * **We need to create one separate Folder for each new Practice Test that we need to onboard.**
   * **We need to create one separate Markdown file for each Questions and the naming conventions for the Questions markdown file should be "Question-(xx).md(Here (xx) is a numeric value for eg Question-01.md)."**  
   * **Once you have authored the practice test in the github, connect with the CloudLabs team to onboard it on the CloudLabs portal.**
